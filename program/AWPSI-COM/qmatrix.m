function qmat=qmatrix(q,t,w,tw,flag)
%QMATRIX ... create a matrix that applies a forward Q filter
%
% qmat=qmatrix(q,t,w,tw,flag)
%
% Generates a matrix which applies a forward Q filter. The qmatrix is also
% bandlimited by a stationary "source signature" waveform. Each column of
% the Q matrix is the theoretical Q impulse response for the traveltime of
% the column convolved with the stationary source waveform. The theoretical
% Q impulse response is computed by einar.m and is based on Kjartanssen
% (1979). The group delay induced by attenuation is often called the drift.
% This is controlled in einar.m by the sample-rate at which the impulse
% response is calculated.
%
% q ... value of Q, may be a single scalar or a vector of length(t)
%        of average Q values
% t ... vector of times to generate q response at
% w ... stationary source waveform
% tw ... time vector for w
% *********** Caution ************
% Q matrix only works properly with causal wavelets. Ideally w should be
% minimum phase.
% *********** Caution ************
% qmat ... length(t) by length(t) matrix which applies a forward Q
%		filter.
% 		If r is a column vector of reflection coefficients, then
%		s=qmat*r; is a simple synthetic seismogram with attenuation.
% flag ... 1 means calcuate the Q impulse response at the seismic sample
%               rate (tw(2)-tw(1))
%      ... 2 means calcuate the Q impulse response at a sample rate of
%           .00002 s whach has a Nyquist of 25kHz and the resample to the
%           seismic sample rate. This simulates the group delay relative to
%           a logging frequency of 12.5kHz but is very expensive.
%      ... 3 means calculate the Q impulse response at the seismic sample
%            rate but then delay it using the theoretical drift time as
%            calculated by tdrift.m .
%     Remark: flag=2 takes a long time. Flag=3 is much quicker and produces
%     similar results. Flag=1 is the simplest option but get unrealistically
%     small drift times.
